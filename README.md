# RNG_JuliaGPU

This repository contains a single script with an example GPU implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm in Julia. I do not recommend using this implementation out of the box because the current version has not undergone extensive testing and it has not been optimized to improve speed and memory footprint. It is my ambition that this implementation can serve as a starting point for building a better version.
