# RNG_JuliaGPU

This repository contains a single script with an example GPU implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm in Julia. I do not recommend using this implementation out of the box because the current implementation is poorly random and slow. But perhaps this implementation could be built on to make something that is open source, fast and highly random.
